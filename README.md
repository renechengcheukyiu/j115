# The Life-Changing Habit of Journaling 
In this final project, I wrote about the benefit of journaling and my journey in adapting this new habit. It was an interesting journey and I hope I can inspire you all to start journaling! 

Journaling has been part of my life ever since 2018. I believe it was a great way for me to improve myself in many aspects of my life and also keep up my motivation. I have seen many changes since I started journaling, and I enjoy journaling everyday to remind myself there are many more interesting aspects in life that I should enjoy.
