                <p>The word, journaling, might scare a lot of people away. It means writing, reflecting, and more writing. <em>"A busy person will not have time to journal."</em> You might think, but journaling is one of the reasons why it keeps you busy and motivated. It is not only a schedule, but also a planner for your life goals.   </p>
                <h2>Why Journaling?</h2>
                <p>Before you start a journal, be clear on why you are writing one. You can literally write anything you want in your journal. You don't have to show anyone else your journal, you don't have to present it in class or at work. It is personal to you only.</p>

                    <p>Questions you may ask:</p>
                <ul>What do I want to achieve in life? </ul>
                <ul>What are my goals for today?</ul>
                <ul>What habits do I want to pick up on in this month?</ul>
                
                <p> Most importantly, a journal is something what makes you who you are, and what do you want to do to improve your life. Think about the habit you wanted to pick up on for a long time, and set it as a goal. Then, write out the ways for you to reach that habit. For example, if you want to lose weight in a month. Be specific on how much weight you want to lose and set a game plan for it. Here are the different sessions you might want to focus on in your journal.  </p>

                <p>Journaling is pretty simple. It helps with self-reflection, and you will realize where you need improvements in your life. Once you reflected and observed the flaws, you can improve based on what you dislike about yourself. After you see the improvements in yourself, you will become more motivated with the strategies you use, and ultimately it will become a habit of yours.  </p>
                
               <h2> The Life-Changing Habit of Journaling </h2> 
                <p> Here are some of the tips on journaling and some improvements I have seen in myself through journaling. Journaling allowed me to reflect, and makes sure I am on track of what I am doing for the day, the week, and the month. It was a great way for me to stay motivated and positive during these difficult times.

                <p>Adam started journaling in April 2020, he is an UI/UX Designer and had a difficult time adjusting to the new normal. During quarantine, he had a hard time sticking to his schedule. There are days where he felt unmotivated, and there are days where he was working long hours with no breaks. Here is what he has to say about journaling after he started. </p>

Remind yourself what are somethings you wanted to achieve, and what are some strategies you can implement into reaching that goal. Give it a try, maybe you will love it. </p>
