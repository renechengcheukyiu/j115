                <p>The word, journaling, might scare a lot of people away. It means writing, reflecting, and more writing. "A busy person will not have time to journal." you might think, but journaling is one of the reasons why it keeps you busy and motivated. It is not only a schedule, but also a planner for your life goals.   </p>
                <h2>Why Journaling?</h2>
                <p>Before you start a journal, be clear on why you are writing one. You can literally write anything in your journal. You don't have to show people your journal, you don't have to present it in class or your at work. It is personal to you only.</p>

                <img class="d-block img-fluid" src= https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1596839082b8fc6c6.jpg> 
                
                    <p>Questions you may ask:</p>
                <ul>What do I want to achieve in life? </ul>
                <ul>What are my goals for today?</ul>
                <ul>What habits do I want to pick up on?</ul>
                
                <p> Most importantly, a journal is something what makes you who you are, and what do you want to improve in your life. Think about the habit you wanted to pick up on for a long time, and set it as a goal. Then, write out the ways for you to reach that habit. For example, if you want to lose weight in a month. Be specific on how much weight you want to lose and set a game plan for it. Here are the different sessions you might want to focus in your journal.  </p>

                <h3>1. Monthly Calendar </h3>
                 <img class="d-block img-fluid" src= https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1597005724d78e1b2.jpg> 
                <p>The monthly calendar helps you to organize your month in advance, and makes sure you are on track of your daily schedule and more. By writing your plans, goals, and achievements, they will help you achieve your goals faster and ensure your life is on track.  </p>
                

                <h3>2. Goals for the year</h3>
                 <img class="d-block img-fluid" src= https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/15970057842df14e4.jpg> 
                <p>Everyone has their own goals. You can write your own goals in your words, and ensure yourself to be looking towards your goals. A dream and a goal is different. It is important to understand a goal is something you can work towards and look forward to. By separating your goals into different aspects of your life, it makes sure you can accomplish that goal. Set small goals and achieve them faster to gain motivation.</p>
                
    
                <h3>3. Self Reflection</h3>
                 <img class="d-block img-fluid" src= https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1597005802fc2711c.jpg> 
                <p>Reflecting your life is very important. It reminds you of what you need to improve and what you need more to achieve in life. Refection keeps you motivated as you see the flaws in your process. Don't be afraid to reflect on your life and yourself. It is one way for better self-improvement. </p>
                
    
                <h3>4. Daily Routine</h3>
                 <img class="d-block img-fluid" src= https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1597005764b0489c4.jpg> 
                <p>Anyone will have their daily routine. No matter how your daily routine looks like, it is important to record yourself. Mark the time of the day you need to take a break or work without distractions. It is essential to make sure you stick to your routine, and also remind yourself, you need a break too.  </p>
                    
                <h3>5. Weekly Review </h3>
                <img class="d-block img-fluid" src= https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/15968390661b00572.jpg> 
                <p> Recap your week and see what you have achieved and what you have not. Write out the ways on how you can be better next week. Also, reward yourself for your accomplishment. Never forget to reward yourself after a busy week.</p>
                

                <h2>The Cycle of Journaling</h2>
                 <img class="d-block img-fluid" src= https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1596840654010b00e.jpg> 
                <p>Journaling is pretty simple. It helps with self-reflection, this is where you realize where you need improvements in your life. Once you reflected and observe the flaws, you improve based on what you dislike about yourself. Once you see improvements in yourself, you get more motivated with the strategies you use, and ultimately it will become a habit of yours.  </p>
                
               <h2> The Life-Changing Habit of Journaling </h2> 
                <p> Here are some of the tips in journaling and some improvements I have seen in myself through journaling. Journaling allowed me to self-reflect, and makes sure I am on track of what I am doing for the day, the week, and the month. It was a great way for me to stay motivated and positives during these difficult times.

        <p> It is important to know that goals can be set anytime in life, and you are the one who will be responsible to reach the goal you wanted. Self-reflection can guide you what you need to improve in your life, and allow you to create your own ways and plans to achieve a goal in life. Remind yourself what are somethings you wanted to achieve, and what are some strategies I can implement into reaching that goal. Journaling can be one of the ways to help you through life and ensure you are on working towards your goal. Give it a try, maybe you will love it. </p>
